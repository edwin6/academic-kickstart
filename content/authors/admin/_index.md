I am currently studying for a PhD at STOR-i, Lancaster University, which I will complete in December 2020.

My research is focused on developing cutting-edge optimization and data science techniques to model and solve large-scale railway timetable rescheduling problems. The project is an industry collaboration with Network Rail.

I am always keen to hear about opportunities to use my advanced skills in optimisation and data science.
